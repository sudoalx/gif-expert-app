# GIF Expert App

## Description

This is a simple app to search and show gifs from Giphy API. I made this app to practice React and APIs as part of my internship.  

I used [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide) to get the gifs, Vite as a bundler and React as a framework.
